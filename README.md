# CREATING ABSTRACT ART BY GAN
The results demonstrate the potential of AI in artistic expression and inspire further exploration in the field of computational creativity.
Using GANs to create abstract art
The image set I am working with is too large to upload here but has been resized and formated for use in a CNN requiring 128x128 pixel resolution.
I would like to increase the allowed resolution of these images and will probably have to migrate to tensor flow to accomplish this.
Currently working with code pieced together from a variety of places to get some images generated before moving on. 
All work is in pytorch.
The trained GAN is capable of producing a wide range of abstract art pieces with varying styles, colors, and compositions. 
The generated artworks exhibit creativity and novelty, often surprising even the creators with their unique aesthetics and visual appeal.
